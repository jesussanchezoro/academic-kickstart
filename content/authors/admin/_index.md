I am Assistant Professor at the Computer Science Department, being one of the senior researchers of the Group for Research on Algorithms For Optimization GRAFO. I have published 24 papers in renowned journals such Information Sciences, Applied Soft Computing, or Computers & Operations Research, among others. Furthermore, I have presented my research in more than 30 national and international conferences. I have also coauthored a chapter in the well-known Handbook of Heuristics. My research is focused in applying metaheuristics for solving real-life hard combinatorial optimization problems.
